* students will learn to use promise constructs to manage asynchronous code.
* students will learn to create a vanilla RESTful API with in-memory persistence.


# Documentation:
  * write a paragraph about what your API does
  * document any resources that helped you complete your assignment
  * define how another dev can 'get started' with your api on their own
      How do i clone it?
      How do i start it?

  * document each of the available endpoints; including example request/response formats for each.

We will keep working on persistence in our next lab.
