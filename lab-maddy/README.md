* students will learn to use promise constructs to manage asynchronous code.
* students will learn to create a vanilla RESTful API with in-memory persistence.


# Documentation:
  * Write a paragraph about what your API does:

  * Document any resources that helped you complete your assignment:
  * Define how another dev can 'get started' with your api on their own:
      - How do i clone it?
      - How do i start it?

  * Document each of the available endpoints; including example request/response formats for each.

  // TODOs:
  // 1. Create a RESTful API using only vanilla JS and Node
  // 2. Modularize our code, and use best practices for separating concerns
  // 3. Have a single 'in-memory' resource/model for persistence (only while server is running)
  // 4. Recreate the basic functionality of ExpressJS as a Router

  // Demo today will complete GET and POST functionality. Students will complete PUT, DELETE, DOCS, and TESTS



We will keep working on persistence in our next lab.
